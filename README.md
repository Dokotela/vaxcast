# VaxCast Immunization Forecasting Service

## Starting All Over Again
- About 18 months ago (Spring 2020), I first wrote this vaccine forecasting program. I'm still pretty proud of it, but it definitely needs retooling, so that's what I'm going to do. I'm also going to try and take meticulous notes so that anyone who wants to can follow along.

- I'm going to start with some spreadsheets, and we'll dive into all that they mean later on. I've uploaded the Excel spreadsheets to Google Cloud, and that's where I'm going to pull the data from.
